# Games
In this repository, I'm showing my creativity by small innovative projects using only HTML, CSS and JS.
## First game🚀
Created 'Guess My Number' web game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players guess numbers within a set range while tracking high scores. Implemented a medium-level UI with engaging design to enhance gameplay experience.
